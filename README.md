## Testing<hr>
No automated testing has been used for this project, all testing has been conducted manully, with numerous users to validate any findings further. 

  TEST 1üß™ : Loading up game with option 1.
  This was done by simply choosing option 1 and going through the default playing settings, to see if anything may arrise.

  -RESULTSüèÜ : The player is able to play using the default settings, all choices from picking a guess to putting in a invalid input to getting a correct and incorrect answer right through to the player winning or losing were bringing back the correct responses. 

  -VERDICT ‚úÖ : The initial gameplay for the option 1 default setting is a pass and completed with no occuring bugs. 

  <hr>

  TEST 2üß™ : Difficulty selection with option 2.
  This was conducted by choosing each difficulty and going through the game, from easy, normal, hard and expert. 

  -RESULTSüèÜ : The player is able to choose from the four options of difficulties and play with the game with the given lives. Easy mode had given the correct number of lives 10, Normal mode had given the correct number of lives 7, Hard mode had given the correct number of lives 5 and lastly Expert mode had given the correct number of lives 3.

  With saying this, hangman graphics were also monitored and this also where changing in accordance to the lives amount. 

  -VERDICT‚úÖ : This test has passed successfully with no bugs being presented. 
 
  <hr>

  TEST 3üß™ : Game Rules option 3.
  This was conducted by choosing by choosing the option 3 to display the games rules, and trying to exit the rules page with the advised instructions, which is the press enter.

  -RESULTSüèÜ : The player is able to choose option 3 and display the games rules, which displayed correctly, but upon trying to exit this area, pressing enter had displayed the message shown below. This was then looked into further.


  -VERDICT‚úÖ : This test has failed due to the bug that was found when trying to exit the results page. This however was recterfied and solved by placing the correct variable name in, which was tries. After changing this, the game was then tested again and was taking the player back to the game menu as intended.

## Deployment
- The site was deployed to Heroku, utilising the Code institute mock terminal.
  The steps to deploy are as follows:
  - Any final commits for the game were push to the repository on Git Hub.
  - A new account with Heroku was made, after which settings was opened to reveal 
    app name and buildpacks.
  - App name was added inaccordance with project name. 
  - Python and nodejs packs were set in the buildpacks section.
  - Navigated to deploy tab clicking on GitHub for deployment method.
  - App was connected to GitHub by locating repository and connnecting.
  - Scrolling down to Manual deploy, the branch was set to main, and deploy branch button was clicked.
  - After waiting for app to be built a link will be provided by Heroku to access the app.
